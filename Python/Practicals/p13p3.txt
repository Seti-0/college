a)

If the line 'print(print_max())' replaces the line 
'print_max()', the program will run as normal, but also
print out 'None' at the end.

This is because print_max() has no return statement and
so is returning 'None' to the print statement.

b)

The print_max statement isn't run, and nothing happens.

This is because the name of the function (without the brackets)
returns an object representing the function, instead of invoking
it. Then, nothing is done with that object.

c)

The print_max function doesn't run, instead,
'<function print_max at 0x7f20fab89670>'
is printed.

Again, the object representing the function was 
retrieved. This time, its string representation was
printed.
