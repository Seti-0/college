The recursive function gives a stack overflow error
starting with an input of 988 on my machine.

The iterative function hasn't given me an error 
yet. 100,000 runs quite quickly, 1,000,000 runs but
it looks like it will take a very long time. I imagine
the iterative version could run until the program runs
out of memory.
