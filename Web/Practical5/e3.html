        /*
            A little bit of math:
            
            3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + ... + 3n
            = 3 (1 + 2 + ... + n)
            = (3/2) (n) (n + 1)
        
            n here is the biggest n such that 3n < 1000
            i.e. n = floor(1000/3)
                                                       
            The same can be done for 5.
                                                       
            So the answer is:
            n = floor(1000/3)
            m = floor(1000/5) - 1
            total = (3/2)(n)(n+1) + (5/2)(m)(m+1)  
            
            (Note the minus 1 on m is because 1000
            is a precise multiple of 5, and we were
            told not to include 1000)
            
            But wait! There are duplicates here
            We've counted all duplicates of 15 twice
            (Arguable this is what the q asks for, but
            it does not match the answer given)
            
            To correct this:
            
            n = floor(1000/15)
            total -= (15/2)(n)(n+1)
        */
                                                       
        var n = Math.floor(1000/3)
        var m = Math.floor(1000/5) - 1
        var total = ((3/2)*n*(n+1)) + ((5/2)*m*(m+1))
        
        n = Math.floor(1000/15)
        total -= (15/2)*n*(n+1)
        
        ans = document.getElementById("ans")
        ans.innerHTML = total
