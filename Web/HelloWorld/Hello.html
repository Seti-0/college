            <p><b>Did you know that the centre of a neutron star might just be strange?</b> And if it is strange,
            then we might be in trouble. When the strange star dies that is. That kind of thing can go places. Or we might die
            from vacuum decay, a thousand little holes in the universe spreading out at lightspeed. Or maybe a giant space ray gun
            could hit our li'l planet.</p>

            <p>This, and many more things, can be learned from a lovely little youtube channel called <b>Kurzgesagt</b></p>
