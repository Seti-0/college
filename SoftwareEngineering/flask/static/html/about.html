        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <h3>View current station and stand availability</h3>
        <p>You can use this page to view current bike or stand availability by
            using the toggle button at the bottom of the page. This is based on
            real-time information from the bike stations and is updated every five minutes.
            A traffic light system is used to indicate the relative availability
            of bikes or stands, as appropriate, at each station for either the
            current time, or future predictions. Red indicates 20% or less availability, orange 30% or less, and green
            indicates above 30% availability.</p>
        <h3>View information about stations</h3>
        <p>Clicking on a station marker will show you more information about the station,
            including the name/address, and whether the station accepts card payment or not.</p>
        <h3>View charts of average past availability</h3>
        <p>In the bottom left corner, there is the option to display charts for the
            currently selected station. With this you can see the average past availability
            for the station for that day of the week, and how it compares for the current dayâ€™s
            availability.</p>
        <h3>View predicted availability</h3>
        <p>You can also enter a time and date within the next five days to view our predictions
            for availability. The prediction model uses historical occupancy and weather data,
            combined with the weather forecast for the requested day/time to predict the bike/stand
            availability of each station.</p>
        <h3>Search for nearby stations</h3>
        <p>If you enter a location in the search box, the map will zoom to show you
            nearby stations and the availability at each. The closest station to your location will be highlighted in
            purple.</p>
        <h3>Plan a route</h3>
        <p>The app also offers a route planner, which allows you to enter a
            start location and an end location, finds the nearest bike station to
            each and shows you the cycling route between them.</p>
